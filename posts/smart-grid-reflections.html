            <h2>1. Introduction: What is a Smart Grid?</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Smart Grid</strong> is an electricity network enhanced with
                <strong>digital communication, automation, advanced sensing, data analytics, distributed generation,
                    storage, and intelligent control systems</strong> that allow utilities and consumers to improve
                reliability, efficiency, sustainability, and economics of electricity delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the traditional grid, which is largely unidirectional (power flows from generation → consumers),
                a smart grid is **bidirectional**, allowing two-way power and data flows. This supports real-time grid
                monitoring, renewable integration, demand response, and self-healing capabilities.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Smart grid technology represents the foundation of the modern power system—reliable, efficient, secure,
                and capable of integrating renewables and distributed generation. While Nigeria still faces significant
                infrastructure and policy gaps, a structured and well-funded smart grid roadmap can transform the
                country’s electricity sector over the next decade.
